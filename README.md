# Payment Gateway Simulator 💳

A comprehensive front-end simulation of a modern payment gateway. This project demonstrates secure payment processing, multiple payment methods, transaction history, and a simulated fraud detection system. It's built entirely with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and uses `localStorage` to persist transaction history.

## ✨ Features

  * **Multiple Payment Methods:** Switch between Credit/Debit Card, PayPal, and Bank Account payments.
  * **Dynamic Form Validation:** Real-time formatting for card numbers and expiry dates.
  * **Transaction Simulation:** Simulates successful, declined, and insufficient funds scenarios using test card numbers.
  * **Fraud Detection:** A basic rules-based engine checks for potential fraud indicators like high/low transaction amounts, use of test cards, and temporary email domains.
  * **Tokenization Simulation:** Demonstrates the concept of tokenizing sensitive payment information.
  * **Persistent History:** All transactions are saved to the browser's `localStorage`.
  * **Tabbed Transaction View:** Filter transaction history by 'All', 'Successful', 'Failed', and 'Fraud Flags'.
  * **Responsive Design:** A clean, modern UI that works well on both desktop and mobile devices.

## 🚀 Getting Started

No complex setup is required\! Since this is a pure front-end project, you can run it directly in your web browser.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/payment-gateway.git
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the directory:**
    ```bash
    cd payment-gateway
    ```
3.  **Open `index.html`:**
    Simply open the `index.html` file in your favorite web browser (like Chrome, Firefox, or Edge).

## 🛠️ How It Works

### Payment Processing

The simulator mimics an API call with a 2-second delay to create a realistic processing feel. It uses predefined test card numbers to trigger specific outcomes:

  * **Success:** `4242 4242 4242 4242`
  * **Decline:** `4000 0000 0000 0002`
  * **Insufficient Funds:** `4000 0000 0000 9995`
    Other card numbers and payment methods have a randomized success/failure rate.

### Fraud Detection

The `checkForFraud()` function in `script.js` applies a set of simple rules to the transaction data. If any rule is triggered, the transaction is flagged. For example:

  * Is the transaction amount unusually high (e.g., \> ₹100,000)?
  * Is a known temporary email service being used?
  * Is a test card number being used?

### Data Persistence

All transaction records are stored as a JSON array in the browser's `localStorage` under the key `paymentTransactions`. This allows your history to remain even after you close the browser tab.

## 💻 Tech Stack

  * **HTML5**
  * **CSS3** (with CSS Variables for easy theming)
  * **Vanilla JavaScript** (ES6+)

No external frameworks or libraries are used, except for Font Awesome for icons.
